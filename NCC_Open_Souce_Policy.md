# Open Source Policy

## Introduction

This policy states NCC Group’s position on the release of software produced by
an employee or contractor of NCC Group (“the Group”) under Open Source licences
and the process that should be followed before they are made publicly
available.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, agency staff, contractors and anyone else
retained to act on behalf of the Group

## Release Procedure
### Software Publishing

The Group will allow an employee to release their software as open source as
long as it conforms to the Group’s Release and Quality Guidelines. The software
should only be released on the Group’s Public Open Source Webpages and will be
released under the Group’s Identity.

### License Choice

All software should only be released under a Group Approved Licence. The
licence choice must be appropriate for the type of software being released.

If the developer of the software wishes to release the software under a dual
licence or if they wish to obtain a personal copy of the software under
a separate licence then they can apply for permission to do so from their line
manager.

### Contribution Agreements

If contributions are submitted via a pull request from a code base hosted on
one of the Group’s Public Open Source Webpages then NCC Group reserves the
right to allow the contributions to be accepted without a Contributors’
Agreement being submitted. The developer should ensure that the contributions
meet all other requirements for being distributed by the Group.

If the Group wishes to retain the possibility of releasing the software under
a different licence in the future, then contributors’ agreements should be
obtained for all contributions.

In all other cases, no contributions should be accepted from a third party
outside the NCC Group of companies without an appropriate contribution
agreement being signed by the contributing third party.

All contributions from Group companies covered by this policy can be accepted
without a contribution agreement being signed.

## Contributing to Open Source

All contributions to non-Group open source projects should be made using
a Group associated ID. Contributions should only be made to appropriate
projects. In general, appropriate projects would be recognised projects used
for Group activities. Further guidance can be obtained from the Technical
Director responsible for Open Source.

### Contribution Agreements

If the open source project requires a Contribution Agreement then appropriate
approval should be obtained before any contributions are made. Should approval
not be granted for contributions to be made under a Group ID then approval for
supplying contributions under a non-Group ID can be applied for.

### Existing Projects

If an entity covered by the scope of this policy joins the Group and already
contributes to an existing project, including any that they own, then they can
continue to contribute to the project under any existing identities used, as
long as all contributions conform to the Group’s IT and Communications
Acceptable Use Policy.

# Group Approved Licenses
## Affero General Public License (AGPL)

By default, all Software should be released under the AGPL.

## Mozilla Public License v2
In some circumstances, the MPLv2 may be a more appropriate license for the
Software. If the developer wishes to use the MPLv2 then appropriate approval
can be sought from their line manager.

## GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
In some circumstances, the LGPL may be a more appropriate license for Software.
If the developer wishes to use the LGPL appropriate approval can be sought from
their line manager.

## Apache Licence Version 2.0
The Apache Licence can also be used for smaller pieces of software (for
example, simple scripts). If the developer wishes to use the Apache Licence
appropriate approval can be sought from their line manager.

## Release and Quality Guidelines
### Project Naming

All Software should be named appropriately. In general, if the name complies
with the IT and Communications Acceptable Use Policy then it is in compliance
with this policy.

### Documentation
All Software should be released with a text file containing details about the
project, its main author, a copyright notice and a reference to the license
under which the project is released. The file should be called “README” and be
placed in the root directory of the project.

### License Files
All Software must be released with a file containing the text of the Group
Approved License under which the Software is being released. The file should be
called “LICENSE” and be placed in the root directory of the project.

### File Headers
All project files should contain appropriate header text that contains the following:

* Main project author, including Group contact details
* A link to the Software’s page on the appropriate Group Open Source Webpage
* The license under which the project has been released and a reference to the
  License File included with the project.

### Coding Guidelines
All content within the project should be considered as external communications
and so must conform to the Group’s IT and Communications Acceptable Use Policy.

## Open Source Webpages
The current list of Group Open Source Webpages is:

* Github – https://github.com/nccgroup
* Bitbucket – https://www.bitbucket.org/nccgroup

## Clarifications and Further Guidance

responsible for Open Source.
